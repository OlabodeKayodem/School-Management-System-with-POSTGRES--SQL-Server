# 🏫 School Management System with PostgreSQL

This project involves the creation of a School Management System database using PostgreSQL. The system aims to manage student information, course details, and student enrollment data efficiently. Below are the tasks to be completed:

## Tasks:

Your manager asked you to answer these questions and put your source codes on GitHub:

1. **Database Creation:** 
   - Write T-SQL scripts to create a database named SchoolManagementSystem.

2. **Table Design:** 
   - Design and create tables to store student information (Students), course details (Courses), and student enrolment data (Enrolments: EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID). Establish relationships between these tables using foreign keys.
   - *Hint: use the “Foreign Key references …” syntax or use Database Diagram Features.*

3. **Data Population:** 
   - Populate the tables with sample data of 10 students, 4 courses, and enroll them in courses.

4. **Data Manipulation:** 
   - Simulate updates by modifying student information (e.g., name change) and course removal.

5. **List of Students:** 
   - Retrieve a list of all students.

6. **Filtering Students:** 
   - Filter students based on grade level.

7. **Course Enrollment Analysis:** 
   - List courses along with the number of enrolled students per course (use aggregate functions like COUNT and GROUP BY).

8. **Student Enrollment in Specific Course:** 
   - Find students enrolled in a specific course.

### Evaluation:

Your performance will be assessed based on the following criteria:
- **Correctness and efficiency of your T-SQL scripts.**
- **Skill in crafting queries to retrieve and analyze data effectively.**
- **Creativity and problem-solving skills demonstrated and tidiness.**

In approaching this project, I embarked on creating a School Management System database using T-SQL. However, due to system constraints, I adapted to PostgreSQL for implementation. The primary goal was to efficiently manage student information, course details, and student enrollment data. Below outlines the steps I undertook to accomplish this:

### 🏢 Database Creation:

1. **Connection Setup:** I initiated connectivity to the PostgreSQL server utilizing pgAdmin, ensuring seamless interaction with the database management system.
2. **Database Creation:** I crafted SQL scripts to instantiate a new database named SchoolManagementSystem, setting the foundation for subsequent operations.

### 📝 Table Design:

3. **Schema Definition:** Through meticulous SQL scripting, I delineated the structure for the necessary tables, encompassing Students, Courses, and Enrollments. Foreign key constraints were established to maintain referential integrity.

### 📊 Data Population:

4. **Sample Data Insertion:** With precision, I composed SQL scripts to inject sample data into the respective tables, comprising 10 students, 4 courses, and their corresponding enrollments.

### 🔄 Data Manipulation:

5. **Update Simulation:** I simulated real-world scenarios by devising SQL scripts to enact updates, such as modifications to student information and course removals.

### 📋 List of Students:

6. **Retrieval Operations:** Leveraging SQL queries, I devised commands to retrieve comprehensive lists of all students stored within the database.

### 🔍 Filtering Students:

7. **Query Refinement:** Through SQL queries, I refined data retrieval processes, enabling the targeted filtering of students based on their grade levels.

### 📊 Course Enrollment Analysis:

8. **Aggregate Functions Utilization:** By harnessing the power of aggregate functions like COUNT and GROUP BY in SQL, I facilitated the generation of detailed reports listing courses alongside the number of enrolled students per course.

### 🎓 Student Enrollment in Specific Course:

9. **Customized Queries:** I engineered tailored SQL queries to pinpoint students enrolled in specific courses, offering granular insights into enrollment dynamics.

### 📁 Source Code Management:

10. **Version Control Integration:** Establishing a GitHub repository, I meticulously organized and documented the SQL scripts and database creation files, ensuring seamless collaboration and version control.

Through diligent execution of these steps, I successfully orchestrated the creation of a robust School Management System using PostgreSQL. The system stands poised to efficiently handle student data, course information, and enrollment processes, showcasing my prowess in database design and manipulation.

## Source Code:

The source code for the PostgreSQL scripts and database creation will be available on GitHub. You can find the repository at insert_link_here.
